Conclusion
==========

The importance of what is taught at a bootcamp is captured in this
[blog post](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/11/why-attend-bootcamp.html).  

The best way get help after a bootcamp is by actually interacting with the programming 
community. Most programming languages/packages have their own mailing lists, user groups, support 
forums and/or conferences (e.g. [PyConAu](http://2014.pycon-au.org/)). Software Carpentry is also 
thinking of [starting a forum](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/11/creating-a-forum.html)
that is like [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) but aimed at a more appropriate level of 
expertise (i.e. for programming novices as opposed to experts).
