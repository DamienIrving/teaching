Parting words of wisdom

* *It's worth investing the time to improve your programming*   
  The real bottleneck in today's computing is not our machines: it's between our ears. The time required to solve a problem is the sum
  of the time required to write correct code and the time spent running it. While computers are getting 
  faster every day, our brains are not, so the first term in this sum is increasingly the most important.  
    
* *Paranoia makes us productive*  
  The best way to imporve productivity (in fact, the only way) is to 
  improve quality. This means (i) stopping to think about the design of a program before we start writing it, 
  (ii) putting checks in your code to make sure that parameters are sensible, data structures consistent, 
  files aren't empty, and so on, and (iii) writing tests, and running them after every code change, to catch 
  errors as soon as possible. This might feel like it's slowing us down at first, but study after study has 
  shown that it works.  

* *Automate everything*  
  As Alfred North Whitehead said, "civilization advances by extending the number of 
  important operations which we can perform without thinking about them." We don't just write programs because we 
  want to do things quickly: we write them because we don't want to do some things ever again. Version control 
  systems keep track of our work for us; spreadsheets update graphs and summary statistics whenever a single value 
  changes, and so on. Every time we automate a task, we reduce the chances of getting it wrong the next time,
  and have more time to think about things that machines *can't* do for us. And it's not just a one-time saving:
  if we automate things well, that extra time is ours over and over again.
