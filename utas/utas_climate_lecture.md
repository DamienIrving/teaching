# The climate system and how it works

Intro: Show a map of the global average temperature and rainfall.

Why do these maps look the way they do?
- Why is most of the planet at a habitable temperature?
- Why are all the major deserts of the world located at a similar latitude north or south? 
- Why is it freezing cold in Newfoundland and Labrador but relatively mild in the UK?
- Why is it so much wetter on the west coast of Tasmania than the east?

To answer those questions and many more, we need to know how the climate system works...

## Planetary energy balance

*See NASA's [best estimate](https://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/energy_budget/) of the planetary energy budget.*

The climate system is powered by radiation from the sun.

This energy warms the planet, but the warming also causes Earth to start radiating energy back into space.
Ultimately, the temperature of the planet will be that at which energy absorbed balances energy lost.

The energy coming from the sun is principally in the shorter wavelengths,
while the energy emitted by Earth surfaces is in the longer wavelengths.
(The wavelengths are dictated by the temperature of the emitter:
Earth is cooler than the sun so it radiates at a longer wavelength).

In general terms, the energy absorbed by the Earth can be written as:  
`EI = (1 – a) * Ω/4`

where `a` is planetary albedo (0.31, this is the proportion of incoming radiation reflected to space and lost) and
`Ω` is the solar constant (about 1367 W m-2, the solar radiation reaching Earth).
We divide by four since the solar energy is spread over the surface of the planetary sphere.
The Earth intercepts a circular area of incoming sunlight,
and this area is spread over a sphere with the same radius as the circle
(area of circle / area of sphere of same radius = 0.25).

The Earth will absorb energy and heat, and as it heats, it will emit radiation.
The energy emitted depends on planetary temperature at the surface where radiation escapes to space.
For simplicity this can be taken as the upper part of the troposphere.

> **Troposphere**
>
> The atmosphere has a number of levels 
> the lowest of which is called the troposphere.
> It contains more than 80% of the mass of the atmosphere,
> it's where most vertical motion and weather changes take place,
> and almost all of the water vapour is contained there.
> It's 15-18km high in the tropics and 8-10km at the poles.

Again in general terms, the energy emitted by the Earth can be written as:  
`EO = σ * T^4`

(T = temperature in Kelvin, σ = 5.67 x 10-8 J/m2 sec K^4)

The Earth's temperature reaches a balance, called a steady state, when the two equations match (`EI` = `EO`).
Under those conditions we can write an equation for planetary temperature.
`T^4 = [(1 – a) Ω] / 4σ` 

The solution for this equation with measured solar flux at the top of the atmosphere
yields a value of -19.2°C for average planetary temperature.
This estimate is close to observed conditions in the upper part of the troposphere,
but of course is much below the average temperature at sea or ground level (about 14°C).
Some factor is causing our climate to be nearly 35°C warmer than we can explain by considering
radiation from the sun alone...


## Greenhouse effect

To explain the higher than expected temperature in the lower troposhere, 
we need to understand its chemical composition.

Dry air is mainly composed of: nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%),
argon (1%) and to a lesser extent carbon dioxide ([415 ppm](https://www.co2.earth/) or 0.0415%).
The remaining fraction is made up of various trace constituents such as methane (1.75 ppm).

In addition, a highly variable amount of water vapour is present in the air.
This ranges from approximately 0% in the coldest part of the atmosphere to as much as 5% in moist and hot regions.
On average, water vapour accounts for 0.25% of the mass of the atmosphere.

A number of these gases are radiatively active, which means they absorb (and radiate) radiation at particular wavelengths.
Collectively these "greenhouse gases" are more-or-less transparent to the shortwave radiation from the sun,
but are somewhat opaque to the longwave radiation emitted from Earth's surface.

So we end up with a situation where the atmosphere is essentially heated from the bottom (i.e. by the longwave radiation)
and the upward/outgoing longwave radiation gets trapped and recycled in the lower atmosphere by greenhouse gases.
A habitable average surface temperature of 14°C is the result,
with a lapse rate (i.e. the rate at which the troposphere cools with height) of about 6.5°C/km.

By their percentage contribution to the greenhouse effect on Earth the four major gases are
water vapor (36–70%), carbon dioxide (9–26%), methane (4–9%) and ozone (3–7%).

## General circulation

### Differential heating

An important detail we haven't addressed so far is that the surface heating by the sun is uneven.
Much more heat is absorbed at low than at high latitudes, 
because Earth's surface gradually tilts away from the sun.
In other words, the average angle of incidence of solar radiation across the year
gradually decreases from the tropics towards the poles.

> **[Seasons](https://allgeographynow.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/the-earths-revolution-around-the-sun/)**
>
> Earth's axis is tilted at 23.5°.
>
> At the equinox (March 21 and September 23) the sun is directly overhead at the equator.
>
> At the winter solstice (June 21) the sun is directly overhead at Tropic of Capricorn (23.5° South)
> and it's dark all day within the Arctic Circle (66.5° North). 
>
> At the summer solstice (December 22) the sun is directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer (23.5° North)
> and it's dark all day within the Antarctic Circle (66.5° South)

This means that at low latitudes Earth's surface actually absorbs more energy
than the upper atmosphere emits to space (an energy surplus)
while at high latitudes the reverse is true (an energy deficit). 

Of course, absorbing more energy than is lost at low latitudes,
and the reverse closer to the poles, is not sustainable.
There has to be a balancing so that temperatures stabilise across the planet,
and this requires a transfer of heat from the equatorial region to higher latitudes.
The transfer is done by large scale motions in the atmosphere and oceans.
These motion (i.e. winds and currents) happen because the solar heating
and heat loss to space, create pressure gradients. 
Air and water move from high to low pressure conditions.

With respect to the atmospheric heat transport,
the strong heating of the bottom of the atmosphere in the tropics
makes the air less dense, so it becomes buoyant and rises (think hot air balloon).
This rising, lower density air in the tropics forms the largest vertical motion in the atmosphere.
From the tropics the rising air spreads poleward at altitude and loses heat to space by radiation.
The cooling causes density to increase and the air sinks.

On a planet that isn't rotating,
a single circulation cell would extend all the way to the poles in either hemisphere.
However, because of the Earth’s rotation, such an atmospheric structure would be unstable.
There are in fact three cells in either hemisphere named Hadley, Ferrel and Polar.

### Coriolis force

One might expect the surface winds associated with the Hadley cells to flow
from the two high pressure regions in the subtropics (i.e. there's one in each hemisphere)
in a north/south direction towards the equator.

In reality, the flow of the winds is modified by the fact
that this motion is happening over a rotating surface.
The Earth spins to the east and the speed of that rotation at the surface
is fastest at the equator and drops to zero at the poles.
That's because the speed depends on the distance which has to be covered in each daily rotation
(about 24,000 miles at the equator and zero at the poles;
so the rotational speed varies from about 1000 to 0 mph).

So, winds blowing to lower latitude get left behind
as they rotate eastward at a lower speed than the surface they are traveling over
(remember that rotation speed increases towards the equator).
This, called the Coriolis Effect, causes winds blowing to the equator to turn towards the west.
The result is a steady wind stream between 10 and 15° of latitude.
These are the tradewinds (also called the Easterlies, as in coming from the East).

Poleward of the high pressure center near 30° latitude,
the inverse of the trades is generated because air flowing poleward
moves over a surface which is rotating at slower and slower speeds.
In this case, the winds veer to the east as their eastward motion outstrips
that of the surface they are flowing over.
In this way a steady flow from west to east (the Westerlies) associated with the Ferrel cell
is created at about 45° latitude.  

> **Why does our weather in Hobart tend to come from the west?**
>
> Due to the mid-latitude westerlies that arise due to the Ferrel cell and Coriolis force.

### Mid-latitiude eddies

In the tropics,
the Hadley cell is the major mechanism by which the energy from the sun is transported polewards.
The Ferrel cell does some of the poleward heat transport in the mid-latitudes,
but the major mechanism is [eddies](https://earth.nullschool.net) embedded in the westerlies.
(Similar to stirring a cup of coffee,
the atmospheric stirring induced by the eddies evens out the temperature gradient between north and south.)
In other words, the high and low pressure systems we see on
[weather maps](http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/charts/) are collectively
doing the bulk of the poleward energy transport in the mid latitudes.
As air moves from the high pressure systems towards low pressure systems,
it is deflected by the coriolis force,
thus the wind circulates anti-clockwise around a high and clockwise around a low
(in the Southern Hemisphere).

> This is because of its location in the mid-latitudes,

> In summer, a low pressure system could move over Melbourne,

> as the system approaches from the west,
> and southerly winds bringing cold air from over the Southern Ocean
> as it departs to the east.

### Different time and space scales

Mid-latitude eddies are a good example of how smaller scale processes
can also have a large and important impact on the climate system.
Highs and lows in the mid-latitudes are "synoptic scale" features
(hundreds of kilometers across, last on the order of weeks)
and obviously much smaller than the Hadley cell,
but are collectively just as important for energy transport.

Smaller scale features are also very important in determining the local climate.
The influence of topography is obvious on global rainfall maps.
The trade winds are forced to rise over topography,
which causes the air to cool, condense and ultimately rain out.
By the time the air arrives on the downslope side of the topography,
it's realtively warm and dry.
This is known as the [foehn effect](http://www.atmo.arizona.edu/students/courselinks/fall12/atmo170a1s1/coming_up/week_9/lect27_regional_winds.html).

> By the time that air gets to the east coast, it's much drier.

At an even smaller scale, the afternoon
[sea breezes](https://www.swellnet.com/news/swellnet-analysis/2017/10/06/understanding-sea-breeze-part-1)
during summer in Sydney
(the land gets so hot it causes localised low pressure that
draws in air from over the relatively cool ocean)
means that the average maximum temperature in coastal suburbs 
like Bondi are substantially lower than for the inland western suburbs.


## Ocean circulation

### Surface currents  
  
Turning out attention to the ocean,
the surface ocean currents arise due to a combination of the surface winds (i.e. the tradewinds and westerlies),
Earth's rotation (the Coriolis force) and Earth's landmasses.  
  
The surface winds blow over the oceans and the water responds to the friction and moves.
Of course, as the water begins to move, the Coriolis Effect comes into play
and the currents veer westwards if going to lower latitudes and easterwards if going poleward.
As a result, the surface ocean currents are driven in circles called
[gyres](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/ocean-gyre/).
There are tropical, subtropical and polar gyres, 
the largest of which are the subtropical gyres that fill the middle of all oceans
and rotate such that poleward flow is on the western side of the basin.
Heat transfer from low to high latitudes is via the western boundary currents of the oceans
(like the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic).

> **Why is it freezing cold in Newfoundland and Labrador but relatively mild in the UK?**
>
> The Gulf Stream carries warm equatorial water up the eastern coast of the United States and on to western Europe,
> bypassing much of the eastern coastline of Canada.

These surface currents operate in a relatively thin upper layer of the sea which is heated by the sun.
This heating is kept relatively close to the ocean surface
because warming water makes it less dense and more resistant to sinking or mixing downwards.
The result is a barrier, called the thermocline, which develops particularly at lower and mid-latitudes
(it is more seasonal poleward) and that separates surface waters from the deep ocean.
The boundary, marked by a rapid downward temperature drop, usually occurs within a few hundred meters of less of the surface.
Below it, the greater mass of the oceans (down to an average depth of about 3800m) is cold and isolated from the winds.

### Deep ocean currents

Despite its isolation from the surface, the deep sea is in motion.
Flow in the deep sea is initiated where the normal, density layered, oceanic water column breaks down
and surface water sinks due to processes which raise its density.
The primary cause of water column destabilization is sea-ice formation.
Making ice, which is fresh, leaves behind a brine which is quite salty.
This cold, highly saline (hence dense) water heads for the deep sea.
It supplies the great deep ocean water masses,
the North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water.

Naturally what goes down must come up if deep currents are going to continue to flow.
Deep waters born in the Atlantic (for instance) spread to the other ocean basins using
the circum-planetary highway that surrounds Antarctica.
This seaway serves as the roundabout connecting all the world's oceans and allowing
deep Atlantic water to spread ultimately to the Pacific.
On average, the trip takes about 800 years.
Along the way water finds return routes to the surface.
Since the deep waters are more dense than those at the surface,
energy has to be used to pump them up.
Ultimately, the energy is provided by the planetary heat gradients as these drive wind and deep ocean flow.

The winds provide upward draw on deep waters thanks to the Coriolis Effect.
Along the eastern sides of ocean basins and around Antarctica winds
(the south easterly trades associated with the Hadley and Polar cells respectively)
blow such that Coriolis veering drives them oceanward, away from the land margin.
The surface waters are drawn away from the coast.
The result is a process called upwelling, which causes deeper water to rise
and replace the water pulled away from the shore.
Upwelling is particularly effective around Antarctica because the water column there is uniformly cold,
which means that the thermocline barrier to vertical motion is weak and waters can be drawn up from depth.
As a result, upwelling in the Southern Ocean provides one of the main avenues by which deep waters eventually surface.

> **Why don't deserts extend to the eastern side of the various continents?** 
> 
> Because the subtropical gyres transport warm surface waters
> to the western side of each ocean basin,
> while upwelling makes the surface waters even colder on the eastern side. 
> Warm surface waters are associated with more evaporation and ultimately rainfall.

Together, the surface currents and deep ocean currents form the
[Global Conveyor Belt](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth103/node/686),
which performs that fundamental task required of the ocean:
the transport of heat from the tropics towards the poles.


### Climate variability

The ocean plays a big role in climate variability... ENSO, IOD.

Decadal: IPO  
Annual: ENSO, SAM, IOD (Show BoM seasonal outlook video, drought)  

Geological timescales: Milankovic cycles, movement of continents, etc 


## Summary

Our weather and climate is driven ultimately by the unequal distribution
of energy that the Earth receives from the Sun.
The poleward transport of energy from the tropics,
combined with the rotation of the earth
(and also the configuration of the continents and ocean basins),
dictates the major features of the climate system:
trade winds, ocean gyres, upwelling,
regions of large-scale convection (rain) and subsidence (desert), etc.
These features modify, and are themselves modified by,
processes happening at smaller time and space scales
(e.g. mid-latitude eddies, sea-breezes),
creating the myriad of different local climates
that people experience around the world.

It's hard enough understanding the interactions between
things happening at different time and space scales in a stable climate,
let alone one that's changing due to greenhouse gas emissions.
The rest of this course will look at how scientists go about doing just that.
