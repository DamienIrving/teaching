Git teaching content
====================

This directory contains the Git related content that I teach at Software Carpentry 
bootcamps. The first two lessons (`00-intro.md` and `01-backup.md`) are the same for
both novice and intermediate audiences, but after that the content diverges. 
* The novice lessons cover the bare minimum that a lone researcher (i.e. not collaborating 
with others) needs to know in order to get started with version control. 
* The intermediate lessons target researchers working/collaborating in a small team and thus 
includes extra material about branching and pull requests. It also contains a final lesson 
on open access / copyright issues, which isn't included in the novice material.   

Other useful resources:  
* [Overview of version control](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/version-control/)  
* [General discussion on backing up your work](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2013/04/16/backing-up-your-work/)
