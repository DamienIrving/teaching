Git teaching content
====================

This directory contains the Git related content that I teach to novice (or beginner

[overview of version control](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/version-control/). 

Another useful resource is this [general discussion on backing up your work](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2013/04/16/backing-up-your-work/).
