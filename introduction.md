What is Software Carpentry?
---
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) is a volunteer organization whose members teach basic software 
skills to researchers in science, engineering, and medicine. It was founded in 1998, but came to prominence in the 
early 2010s when it shifted to a teaching model centred around intensive two-day 
[bootcamps](http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/index.html) (see [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5448) for a detailed history of the 
organisation). 


Why do researchers need help with programming?
---
1. The volume of data available to researchers is growing exponentially, which means a simple Excel 
   spreadsheet just doesn't cut it in today's world of [big data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data). 
2. Most researchers are self taught programmers. As a result, they spend hours doing things that 
   should take minutes, reinvent a lot of wheels, and still don't know if their results are reliable.
3. This rapid increase in data, coupled with the low computational competency of the community, has resulted in 
   something of an [irreproducibility crisis](http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/reproducibility/index.html) in 
   published research. However, the world's most prominent journals are 
   [waking up to this problem](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2013/06/30/the-future-of-journal-submissions/), 
   and are beginning to require that people submit their code along with their manuscript (a terrifying prospect 
   for most researchers!).

       
What gets taught at a bootcamp?
---
Our goal is to teach a handful of basic computing skills, so that researchers can get more done in less time. Our goal is 
not to produce professional programmers. By way of analogy, we think every researcher should know about as much about
computing as they do about statistics. Most researchers don't have a degree in statistics, but at some point they've 
learned what correlation means, what statistical significance is, and so on. 

Our syllabus focuses on well established [best practices in scientific computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0530) and 
covers three major domains:

1. The command line
2. Programming fundamentals (readability, defensive programming, testing, etc) 
3. Version control

The focus is very much on concepts, not specific tools. This means that a Matlab user can come to a bootcamp and get a 
lot out of it, even if the programming content is taught using Python. Once you understand the fundamental concepts
underpinning effective scientific computing, you can teach yourself the tools that you need to use (the reverse isn't 
usually true).


Who is this guy teaching us?
---
Similar to most [qualified](http://software-carpentry.org/badges/index.html) Software Carpentry instructors, I'm a 
research scientist and not a professional software developer (see my 
[bio](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/who-is-dr-climate/)). This avoids a well-known teaching phenomenon called 
*expert blind spot*. In other words, Software Carpentry instructors can still remember what it's like to not understand 
this stuff, which makes them better teachers.

For a more in depth discussion of the history, syllabus and benefits of Software Carpentry, 
check out this [talk I gave at PyCon Australia](http://pyvideo.org/video/2230/software-carpentry-arrives-down-under).


What is the teaching format?
---
The syllabus is delivered via lecture/demonstration interspersed with regular challenges to be worked on in pairs.
During the lectures, you can either:
* View the lecture notes (available in this repository)
* Open a terminal window or IPython notebook and follow along
* Do nothing but sit back and watch
* A combination of the above
