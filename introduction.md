What is Software Carpentry?
---
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) is a volunteer organization whose members teach basic software skills to researchers in science, engineering, and medicine. It was founded in 1998, but came to prominence in the early 2010s with the advent of its [bootcamps](http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/index.html) ([this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5448) outlines the history of the organisation). I recently gave a [talk](http://pyvideo.org/video/2230/software-carpentry-arrives-down-under) at PyConAu about Software Carpnetry activities in Austraia.    

Why do researchers need help with programming?

1. The volume of data available to researchers is growing exponentially, which means your trusty Excel 
   spreadsheet just isn't going to cut it in today's world of [big data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data). 
2. Most researchers are self taught programmers. As a result, they spend hours doing things that 
   should take minutes, reinvent a lot of wheels, and still don't know if their results are reliable.
3. This rapid increase in data, coupled with the low computational competency of the community, has resulted in something of an [irreproducibility crisis](http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/reproducibility/index.html) in published research. The world's most prominent journals are [beginning to wake up to this problem](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2013/06/30/the-future-of-journal-submissions/), and are now requiring that people submit their code along with their manuscript!    
       
Who is this guy teaching us?

Similar to most [qualified](http://software-carpentry.org/badges/index.html) Software Carpentry instructors, I'm a research scientist and not a professional software developer (see my [bio](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/who-is-dr-climate/)). This avoids the *expert blind spot*, meaning that Software Carpentry instructors can still remember what it's like to not understand this stuff!    

What gets taught at a bootcamp?
---
We focus on [best practices in scientific computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0530), with the syllabus covering three major domains:

1. The command line
2. Programming fundamentals (readability, defensive programming, testing, etc) 
3. Version control

The focus is on concepts, not specific tools. Once you understand the concepts you can teach yourself the tools; the reverse isn't true.
