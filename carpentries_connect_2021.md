## Tips for good contributions

Useful (small) contributions:
- Bug/typo fixes
- Factual errors
- Clearer explanations
- Exercises (with solutions)
- Supporting information (e.g. lesson objectives, instructor notes)

Useful (larger) contributions
- Identify (and propose fixes for) conflicts with best practice
- Suggestions for large updates / new directions

Less useful contributions
- Requests for niche content
- Technical overload

Make sure:
- You're aware of the broader lesson narrative
- Submit an issue first for large contributions (i.e. before working on a PR)

It helps if:
- You've taught the lesson

Don't worry if:
- [Previewing pages locally](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/07-checking/index.html) is too hard 
  - Simply submit text and the lesson maintainers can deal with the formatting.
