TROUBLE SHOOTING

- If you didn't make the Anaconda python the default python upon installation:
  - You may wish to edit your .bashrc or .bash_profile file or prepend the Anaconda install location:
    $ export PATH=/usr/local/anaconda/bin:$PATH
  - Or just .../anaconda/bin/python

- Screen resolution
 - Apple -> system preferences -> displays
 - My usual resolution is 1440 X 900

- Wireless (setting up our own network)
 - Login to the admin console on the router itself at 192.168.1.1 using admin:password!
 - But first you need to go buy a tesltra usb dongle. Or its equivalent ZTE MF821 model dongle.
