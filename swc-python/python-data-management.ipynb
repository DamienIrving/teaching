      "Our previous lessons have shown us how to write programs that ingest a list of data files, perform some calculations on those data, and then print a final result to the screen. While this was a useful exercise in learning the principles of scripting and parsing the command line, in most cases the output of our programs will not be so simple. Instead, programs typically take data as input, manipulate that data, and then output yet more data. Over the course of a multi-year research project, most reseachers will write many different programs that produce many different output datasets. "
