This directory contains new Python lessons that I'm working on.

Each lesson is saved as a separate IPython notebook. To view these notebooks, you can 
either navigate to associated nbviewer page, 

[data.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/7572585)  
[numerical.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/7572558)  

Below is a summary of these extra lessons, which are supposed to be taught after the
core novice Python lessons:


### Data Management

Your data should contain sufficient metadata to be self describing. 
(data.ipynb)

*Topics:* metadata, [CF compliance](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/are-you-cf-compliant/) 
  

### Number Crunching 

Make use of libraries that have been optimised to handle large numeric arrays quickly and reliably.
Be aware of the issues associated with floating point arithmetic. 
(numerical.ipynb)

*Topics:* linear algebra, numerical data types, matrix programming, floating point arithmetic
  

### Masterclass

If time permits at a bootcamp, a masterclass/Q&A session can be held.

*Topics:* debugging (pdb), exception handling (try/except), advanced command line argument handling (argparse)
