# Lesson order #

1. Introduction
- Topics: importing libraries/modules (the former being a large collection of the latter),
  calling functions/attributes (modules) or methods/members (classes) and members, reading
  and storing data, variable assignment, indexing (including slice and stride), basic 
  plotting (matplotlib), array operations 
- Main point: an example of how to do typical tasks in Python 
- Notebook: python-intro.ipynb
- Sketches: variable assignment
- Time:

2. Functions
- Topics: defining functions, call stack, doc strings, positional and keyword arguments 
  (also called parameters)
- Main points: 
  - functions are used to repeat multiple operations with a single command
  - use them to write code in small re-usable chunks (enhances readability, reduces 
    duplication)
- Notebook: python-functions.ipynb
- Sketches: call stack
- Time:

- Possible edits: Remove the testing content, because that comes later?

3. Loops and indexing
- Topics: loops (if, while)
- Main point: get the computer to complete repetitive tasks for you
- Notebook: python-loops.ipynb
- Time:

4. Conditionals and defensive programming
- Topics: booleans, assertions
- Main point: add assertions to your code
- Notebook: ?? Greg to forward
- Time:

5. File i/o and lists
- Not sure if this topic is required, or whether the content is covered in the intro

6. Errors
- Topics: debugger tools,  
- Main point:
- Notebook: python-errors.ipynb
- Time:

7. Testing
- Topics: unit testing
- Main point: how, why, and when to test your code
- Notebook: python-testing.ipynb
- Time:

8. Command line
- Topics: sys.argv, argparse
- Main point: write code that gives options at the command line, so you don't have to 
  continually manually edit your code (also aids documentation)
- Notebook: python-cmdline.ipynb
- Time:

9. Number crunching
- Topics: numpy indexing, matrix programming, floating point arithmetic
- Main point: there are some things you to know when dealing with numbers 
- Notebook: python-numerical.ipynb
- Time:
