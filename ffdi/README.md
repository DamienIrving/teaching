## Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI)

This directory contains a simple example of how the xclim package
can be used to calculate the FFDI (see `ffdi_demo.ipynb`).

The xclim indices documentation can be found at:  
https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html

If you need to calculate the FFDI for a large dataset,
see the GitHub repository maintained by the Australian Climate Service
fire hazard team for guidance and advice:
