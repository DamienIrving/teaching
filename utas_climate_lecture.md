# The climate system and how it works

Intro: Show a map of the global average temperature and rainfall.

Why do these maps look the way they do?
- Why is most of the planet at a habitable temperature?
- Why are all the major deserts of the world located at a similar latitude north or south? 
- Why does our weather in Hobart tend to come from the west?
- Why is it four seasons in one day/week in Melbourne
  but basically the same weather every singe day in Darwin?
- Why is it freezing cold in Newfoundland and Labrador but relatively mild in the UK?

To answer those questions, we need to know how the climate system works...

## Planetary energy balance

The climate system is powered by radiation from the sun.

This energy warms the planet, but the warming also causes Earth to start radiating energy back into space.
Ultimately, the temperature of the planet will be that at which energy absorbed balances energy lost.

The energy coming from the sun is principally in the shorter wavelengths (0.3–1µm)
while the energy emitted by Earth surfaces is in the longer wavelength infrared (4–100µm).
(The wavelengths are dictated by the temperature of the emitter:
Earth is cooler than the sun so it radiates at a longer wavelength).

In general terms, the energy absorbed by the Earth can be written as:  
`EI = (1 – a) * Ω/4`

where `a` is planetary albedo (0.31, this is the proportion of incoming radiation reflected to space and lost) and
`Ω` is the solar constant (about 1367 W m-2, the solar radiation reaching Earth).
We divide by four since the solar energy is spread over the surface of the planetary sphere.
The Earth intercepts a circular area of incoming sunlight,
and this area is spread over a sphere with the same radius as the circle
(area of circle / area of sphere of same radius = 0.25).

The Earth will absorb energy and heat, and as it heats, it will emit radiation.
The energy emitted depends on planetary temperature at the surface where radiation escapes to space.
For simplicity this can be taken as the upper part of the troposphere.

> **Troposphere**
>
> The atmosphere has a number of levels 
> the lowest of which is called the troposphere.
> It contains more than 80% of the mass of the atmosphere,
> it's where most vertical motion and weather changes take place,
> and almost all of the water vapour is contained there.
> It's 15-18km high in the tropics and 8-10km at the poles.

Again in general terms, the energy emitted by the Earth can be written as:  
`EO = σ * T^4`

(T = temperature in Kelvin, σ = 5.67 x 10-8 J/m2 sec K^4)

The Earth's temperature reaches a balance, called a steady state, when the two equations match (`EI` = `EO`).
Under those conditions we can write an equation for planetary temperature.
`T^4 = [(1 – a) Ω] / 4σ` 

The solution for this equation with measured solar flux at the top of the atmosphere
yields a value of -19.2°C for average planetary temperature.
This estimate is close to observed conditions in the upper part of the troposphere,
but of course is much below the average temperature at sea or ground level (about 14°C).
Some factor is causing our climate to be nearly 35°C warmer than we can explain by considering
radiation from the sun alone...


## Greenhouse effect

To explain the higher than expected temperature in the lower troposhere, 
we need to understand its chemical composition.

Dry air is mainly composed of: nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%),
argon (1%) and to a lesser extent carbon dioxide ([415 ppm](https://www.co2.earth/) or 0.0415%).
The remaining fraction is made up of various trace constituents such as methane (1.75 ppm).

In addition, a highly variable amount of water vapour is present in the air.
This ranges from approximately 0% in the coldest part of the atmosphere to as much as 5% in moist and hot regions.
On average, water vapour accounts for 0.25% of the mass of the atmosphere.

A number of these gases are radiatively active, which means they absorb (and radiate) radiation at particular wavelengths.
Collectively these "greenhouse gases" are more-or-less transparent to the shortwave radiation from the sun,
but are somewhat opaque to the longwave radiation emitted from Earth's surface.

So we end up with a situation where the atmosphere is essentially heated from the bottom (i.e. by the longwave radiation)
and the upward/outgoing longwave radiation gets trapped and recycled in the lower atmosphere by greenhouse gases.
A habitable average surface temperature of 14°C is the result,
with a lapse rate (i.e. the rate at which the troposphere cools with height) of about 6.5°C/km.

By their percentage contribution to the greenhouse effect on Earth the four major gases are
water vapor (36–70%), carbon dioxide (9–26%), methane (4–9%) and ozone (3–7%).

## General circulation

- Radiation budget + Coriolis force
- Hadley Cell, mid latitude eddies, geostrophic balance, jet streams

An important detail we haven't addressed so far is that the surface heating by the sun is uneven.
Much more heat is absorbed at low than at high latitudes, 
because Earth's surface gradually tilts away from the sun.
In other words, the average angle of incidence of solar radiation across the year
gradually decreases from the tropics towards the poles.

This means that at low latitudes Earth's surface actually absorbs more energy
than the upper atmosphere emits to space (an energy surplus)
while at high latitudes the reverse is true (an energy deficit). 

Of course, absorbing more energy than is lost at low latitudes,
and the reverse closer to the poles, is not sustainable.
There has to be a balancing so that temperatures stabilise across the planet,
and this requires a transfer of heat from the equatorial region to higher latitudes.
The transfer is done by large scale motions in the atmosphere and oceans.
These motion (i.e. winds and currents) happen because the solar heating
and heat loss to space, create pressure gradients. 
Air and water move from high to low pressure conditions.

With respect to the atmospheric heat transport,
the strong heating of the bottom of the atmosphere in the tropics
makes the air less dense, so it becomes buoyant and rises (think hot air balloon).
This rising, lower density air in the tropics forms the largest vertical motion in the atmosphere.
From the tropics the rising air spreads poleward at altitude and loses heat to space by radiation.
The cooling causes density to increase and the air sinks.

On a planet that isn't rotating,
these large circulation cells would extend all the way to the poles.
However, because of the Earth’s rotation, such an atmospheric structure would be unstable.
Consequently, the two cells driven by the ascendance at the Equator, called the Hadley cells,
close with a downward branch at a latitude of about 30°.

The downward limb of the Hadley Cell creates a region of higher pressure
at the Earth's surface that balances the area of low pressure along the equator.
Along the surface the pressure gradient will make the winds blow from mid to low latitude.
A pressure gradient also develops poleward of 30° so that winds are driven to higher latitudes as well.
So, from the mid-latitude surface high pressure center, winds head north and south.

## Ocean circulation

- Surface currents driven by winds (gyres etc)
- Then a thermocline 
- Deep water formation at the poles is what drives the deeper currents


## Different temporal and spacial scales

The general circulation and thermohaline circulation do a good job at describing the large scale climate,
but smaller scale factors are important for local differences:
- Topography: Strahan much wetter than Swansea
- Land/ocean distribution: Much colder winters in New Hampshire than here, much cooler in the eastern suburbs of Sydney due to sea breeze


## Climate variability

Geological timescales: Milankovic cycles, movement of continents, etc  
Decadal: IPO  
Annual: ENSO, SAM, IOD (Show BoM seasonal outlook video, drought)  


## Summary

Our weather and climate is driven ultimately by the energy the Earth receives from the Sun.
The conditions we experience around the world are governed by the way this energy
is redistributed by the atmosphere and oceans.

The behaviour of the atmosphere and oceans is governed by fundamental laws of physics.
The behaviour is very complex because many different processes and scales - from microscopic to global - are involved.
This complexity is the reason that understanding, simulating and predicting the climate system is such a big challenge.
