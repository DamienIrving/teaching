These teaching notes are from a class that Greg Wilson taught at LBL in November 2013. He said that he'd change quite a few of the details,
but thinks the overall idea is solid - for most scientists, the web is a way to move data around, and presentation issues (CSS and anything
involving Javascript) are secondary. Further discussion on this topic can be found at the Software Carpentry blog
[here](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2012/04/what-to-teach-researchers-about-the-web.html) and
[here](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2012/04/straw-man-for-web-programming.html). The notes are not yet part of the Software Carpentry 
github repository, but this is high on his to-do list.
