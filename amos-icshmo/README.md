#### 0. Tour of the stack

i.e. What libraries are we going to use for the task? [This post](https://drclimate.wordpress.com/2016/10/04/the-weatherclimate-python-stack/) summarises the stack.

#### 1. Install libraries using conda

iris, gitpython, jupyter, cmocean

#### 2. Interacting with Python

Brief walk through Python at the command line, ipython at the command line, popular IDE's (e.g. Spyder) and finally the Jupyter notebook.

#### 3. Functions / modular code

#### 4. Vectorisation

#### 5. Testing and defensive programming

#### 6. Command line programs

#### 7. Version control with git

#### 8. Data provenace
