## Workshop outline

Task: Plot the global precipitation climatology (over land) for the ACCESS1-3 and CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 models.

#### 0. Tour of the stack

i.e. What libraries are we going to use for the task? [This post](https://drclimate.wordpress.com/2016/10/04/the-weatherclimate-python-stack/) summarises the stack.

#### 1. Install libraries using conda

See [conda.md](https://github.com/DamienIrving/teaching/blob/master/amos-icshmo/conda.md)

#### 2. Interacting with Python

Brief walk through Python at the command line, ipython at the command line, popular IDE's (e.g. Spyder) and finally the Jupyter notebook.

#### 3. Visualising CMIP data

See [visualising_cmip_data.ipynb](https://github.com/DamienIrving/teaching/blob/master/amos-icshmo/visualising_cmip_data.ipynb)

#### 4. Functions / modular code

See [functions.ipynb](https://github.com/DamienIrving/teaching/blob/master/amos-icshmo/functions.ipynb)

#### 5. Vectorisation

See [vectorisation.ipynb](https://github.com/DamienIrving/teaching/blob/master/amos-icshmo/vectorisation.ipynb)

#### 6. Command line programs

See [command_line_programs.md](https://github.com/DamienIrving/teaching/blob/master/amos-icshmo/command_line_programs.md).  
Give scaffold script, they need to fill it with functions developed earlier. (Use pdb)

#### 7. Version control with git

Create repo.  
Track changes as we edit code so it puts two plots on one figure 

#### 8. Testing and defensive programming

Add assertions to script
(with [SWC assertions example](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/08-defensive/) first if there's time).

#### 9. Data provenace

Create timestamp functions.  
Put them in a separate module and import them.
